# IDO

IDO covers just those entities that are relevant to
infectious diseases generally, and not to specific infec-
tious diseases associated with specific pathogens. Its
coverage ranges across biological scales (gene, cell,
organ, organism, population), disciplinary perspectives
(biological, clinical, epidemiological), and successive
stages along the chain of infection (host, reservoir, vec-
tor, pathogen)
